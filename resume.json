    "summary": "Family-first husband and father of two boys, I believe a good work-life balance is essential to maintaining the focus and productivity needed to achieve great results. I believe in using the right tool for the job to get that done in the most effective and efficient manner possible. In my 15+ years of experience, that has involved the use of various tools and platforms, but most recently my focus and specialization has been on native front-end web application development using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I'm passionate about delivering high-quality, user-friendly solutions that deliver business value to my customers and clients on the most ubiquitous and accessible platform available to them: the web.",
